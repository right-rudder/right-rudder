              Our very first episode!  We're going to be presenting our webinar on LinkedIn Events.  During the webinar we’ll be talking about student retention and attrition at flight schools.  It’s estimated that 80% of students drop out before ever receiving their certificate.  We’ll look at the reasons this is and then we’ll talk about some ideas that flight schools can use today to reduce attrition and increase retention.  Looking forward to seeing you all there!
