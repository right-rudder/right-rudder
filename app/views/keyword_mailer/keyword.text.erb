We'll reach out in a few moments to see how you're doing and if you're interested in scheduling a growth accelerator session with Right Rudder.  This is where we'd go over what your digital marketing looks like today, what your competition is doing, and a strategy specifically tailored for your flight school business.  The session is absolutely risk free and no cost.  Even flight schools that don't end up using Right Rudder find the session to be very beneficial.

Looking forward to talking with you, <%= @name %>.
