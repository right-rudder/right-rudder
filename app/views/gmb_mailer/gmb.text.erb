**You're going to be the #1 flight school in your area**

Hi <%= @name %>,

We're excited to connect with you and introduce you to the Flight School Google Business Profile Optimization Checklist. We designed this checklist after experimenting with hundreds of different Google Business Profiles for flight schools all across the country.  It contains the strategies we use for our flight school partners to get them on the top of Google search.

We'll reach out in a few moments to see how you're doing to see if you're interested in scheduling a growth accelerator session with Right Rudder.  This is where we'd go over what your digital marketing looks like today, what your competition is doing, and a strategy specifically tailored for your flight school business.  The session is absolutely risk free and no cost.  Even flight schools that don't end up using Right Rudder find the session to be very beneficial.

Looking forward to talking with you, <%= @name %>.
