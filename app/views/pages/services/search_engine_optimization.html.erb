          SEO is the process of getting your website to show up in the Organic (FREE / non sponsored) section of the search engines. 
          There are specific things that you can do both on and off your website to ensure that you show up when someone types “Flight School + Your City” into Google, Yahoo or Bing. 
        </p>
        <p class="pt-5 px-10 pb-10">

      <h3 class="text-5xl font-bold italic text-center pb-10">The Two SEO Methods Used to Rank Higher</h3>
      <p>
        There are two methods used in SEO to get your flight school to rank higher.
        The first is <b>on page optimization</b>.  What this entails is optimizing the code on your website so that search engines understand your page better.
        In addition to helping search engines understand your page better, Google, Bing, and Yahoo take consideration the user experience of the website.  
      </p>
      <h5 class="py-10 text-2xl font-semibold">
        If your website is loading slow or doesn't fit well in the screens of mobile phones, then your site will rank lower.
      </h5>
      <h4 class="italic text-xl pb-5">Page Speed</h4>
      <p class="pb-5">
        Many of you may be asking how to increase page speed.  
        It's helpful to understand how websites generally work that way you can understand how to optimize for page speed. 
        A website, in essence, is a bunch of code sent to your browser.  Your browser then interprets the code and then displays a webpage.  
        Just like the Right Rudder Marketing site you are looking at now. 
      </p>
      <p class="pb-5">
        Most marketing agencies and web designers aren't technical.  So they rely on editors to generate the code.  
        This may include WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, and GoDaddy.  These software packages are like a Boeing manufacturing plant. 
        They're big, take up alot of space, and are designed to build one type of plane.
        Building a website in this way means that the entire factory or software engine has to be loaded first, then that software has to build the finished product.  
        Metaphors aside, this bloatware is the biggest reason why websites built with a no-code editor are slow.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Right Rudder Marketing does differently is that we build the website from scratch and code line by line.  We only program using the absolute minimum requirements for the code to run which reduces file size and increases page speed.
      </p>
      <h5 class="py-10 text-2xl font-semibold">
        Right Rudder Marketing Websites load fast and are efficient.  They are optimized for mobile and all screen sizes.
      </h5>
      <h4 class="italic text-xl pb-5">Content</h4>
      <p class="pb-5">
        When it comes to optimizing your flight school's website for search engines like Google, content creation plays a pivotal role. By developing relevant and informative content that revolves around flight training, you not only provide valuable insights to your audience but also assist search engines in understanding the nature and purpose of your website. This, in turn, enhances your website's chances of ranking higher in search engine results.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-5">
        By incorporating flight school related keywords and phrases naturally into your website's content, you effectively signal to search engines that your flight school's website is a reliable and authoritative source in the flight training industry. By consistently creating content that aligns with your target audience's interests and search intent, you can establish your flight school as a go-to resource, thereby increasing your website's visibility and credibility.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-5">
        In addition to optimizing your website's static pages, maintaining an active blog is a powerful strategy to boost your on page SEO efforts. By regularly publishing informative and engaging blog posts on flight training topics, you not only keep your website fresh and up to date but also provide search engines with new content to index. Each blog post becomes an opportunity to incorporate relevant keywords, answer common questions, and provide valuable information to potential and current student pilots.
      </p>
      <h5 class="py-10 text-2xl font-semibold">
        Incorporate relevant keywords and phrases naturally into your website to become the authoritative source in the flight training industry.
